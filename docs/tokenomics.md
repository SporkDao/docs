SPORK is the ecosystem’s native BEP-20 token and will be used for incentives, governance, project development, swaps and token burns. SPORK is planned to be a cross-chain asset, with future plans of migration to chains such as ERC-20, DOT, and others. As for investors and liquidity providers, the SPORK token’s ownership makes them eligible for a range of use-cases.

## Use Cases

The SPORK token has several use-cases within the Spork ecosystem:
 
* Additional Benefits: Investors holding Spork tokens get additional benefits and better swap ratios for pools running on the platform, as outlined in the previous sections.


* Governance: The Spork platform will implement a DAO consensus mechanism, enabling SPORK holders to gain voting rights by staking their tokens in designated wallets. In general, the mechanism will involve limited-period staking, to be defined in detail at the time of the platform’s governance launch. In the spirit of fair value and democracy, staking votes will yield rewards based on weight, but 1 vote per staker will be strictly enforced so the protocol is not dominated by larger holders.


* Staking: Spork token holders will be able to generate annual passive income from their SPORK tokens, simply by holding their tokens in specific BEP20 wallets. Periodically there will be staking pools where Sporks may stake their SPORK tokens in Farming Pools to receive additional rewards on top of the dividend tax fees.


* LP Pools: Sporks that provide SPORK tokens via specific liquidity pools (Pancake,Uniswap, etc.) will have the chance to gain additional rewards, on top of staking rewards generated from dividend tax fees. Simply add liquidity to the specific pool and stake your LP tokens in the corresponding farm.


* Transactions Fees (Dividends, YE Bonus, Burn): Spork token transactions automatically apply a 5% tax for purchase and sales. This tax is collected to incentivise holders with dividend payments on transactions. It is also implemented to prevent front runner bots from abusing our system. 1% is paid out to all holders, while 3% is sent to the year-end Bonus contract, 0.5% sent to reserve and 0.5% is burnt to create deflation. Users that stake their tokens in contracts or simply hold in their wallet will automatically receive all rewards, anywhere tokens are kept.


* Token Burn/Burn Swap: Spork will adopt periodic token burns to increase the value and scarcity in Spork token as popularity grows. Spork will also include a Burn Swap for future projects where users will be able to swap SPORK for an allotted amount of tokens of upcoming projects. This will allow users to swap to new tokens, without impacting the price of SPORK negatively. All SPORK tokens swapped will be burnt.


* Reserve: Tokens allocated in the reserve are for future initiatives meant to preserve the protocol long term and will also serve as a form of insurance for our users. The reserve funds will be in control of the DAO and use of the reserve funds will be enacted via governance vote only.
